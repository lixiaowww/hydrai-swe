      "description": "This repository includes two folders. \"Maps\" folder is the 25-year return level extreme maps of 4-km gridded snow water equivalent (SWE) and 7-day snowmelt and runoff potential (RP) and over North America. The other one, \"R_code\", is R code scripts used in the analysis presented in this paper. The maps are developed by using 25-km gridded historical and future simulation data sets from the North American Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (NA-CORDEX) under the Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 8.5.
